Source code for my personal website ([link](sahildash.vercel.app))

---

## Running
In order to run locally, at the root of the project, type:
```bash
npm install --prefix projects/chat_app
```
Then run:
```bash
node projects/chat_app/server.js
```
and navigate to the link shown in the terminal, for example: `http://localhost:8000`

---

(Note: you dont *need* node and npm to run website, they are just there so the real time chat app (one of my projects) works correctly. The rest of the website will work fine if you simply click on index.html and navigate though pages like that, but the chat app will not work wihtout running those commands.)
