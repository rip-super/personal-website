            Hey! I'm Sahil. I'm a freshman going to Mcneil High School, and if it isn't obvious enough, I like programming. I enjoy working on a bunch
            of differents projects, in a variety of languages. Even though I have this website, I consider myself better in backend development than
            frontend.

            <br><br>

            Normally, people would put their favorite language or something like that here, but honestly, I don't really have one. I've been juggling
            Python, Rust and C++ for most of my projects, and enjoy using all of them. I also use Javascript from time to time with the help of
            Node and NPM.

            <br><br>

            Some of my other interests include Tennis, Orchestra (Violinist), Chess (still terrible at it lol), Cubing, Minecraft, Hollow Knight and
            Hollow Knight Silksong and arranging sheet music.

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            Some cool projects I've worked on. For a more complete list, feel free to checkout the PROJECTS page
            <br><br>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Real Time Chat App</strong> - A JavaScript chat app that lets users message each other live across devices.
                    Supports custom usernames, system messages, and basic moderation. You can try it out right here!
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Pychess</strong> - A chess engine written in Python with a GUI supporting PvP, PvC, and CvC matches. Implements all chess
                    rules, has square highlighting, and a (not very smart) AI.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Rustle</strong> - A search engine built from scratch using Rust and Tauri, as a way for me to learn how search engines
                    actually work. Implements page indexing and ranking instead of just being a Google wrapper (I'm not that lazy, trust).
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>MPIC</strong> - The Minimal Pixel Interface for C++, my most recent project, an engine focused on simplicity and
                    performance using OpenGL. Still in active development, but I hope to finish it in the very near future.
